I recently had the privilege of participating in a webinar organised by the [International Indian Statistical Association](https://www.intindstat.org/) and [Health Technology Assessment International](https://htai.org/). I talked about the pivotal role of statisticians in health technology assessment and market access globally, a very timely topic! I was joined by Jani Mueller (HTAi) and Abhirup Dutta Majumdar (PharmaQuant).
