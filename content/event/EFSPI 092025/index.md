I had the privilege of participating in the [10th EFSPI Regulatory Statistics Workshop](https://efspieurope.github.io/workshop/data/2025/slides.html) in Basel, where I gave a talk on estimands for evidence synthesis. My presentation was part of a session ``From Trials to Target Populations -- Extending Evidence for Decision-Making''. Seamus Kent (Erasmus University Rotterdam) set the stage very nicely and Miguel Hernán (Harvard University) gave a fantastic presentation guiding us through target trial emulation using observational data. The presentations were followed by an exciting panel discussion and Q&A together with Anja Schiel. 

My presentation stressed that estimands are just as crucial for synthesizing multiple trials as they are for individual trials. In particular, summary measures and intercurrent event strategies -- not components of frameworks such as PICO -- are important components of the research question and sources of heterogeneity in meta-analyses.
