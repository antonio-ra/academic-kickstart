This Wednesday, I had the privilege of speaking alongside Shannon Cope (PRECISIONheor) and Harlan Campbell (University of British Columbia) in a breakout session about Advanced Methods for Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) at [ISPOR 2024](https://www.ispor.org/conferences-education/conferences/past-conferences/ispor-2024) in Atlanta. 

Shannon chaired the session, discussed the main limitations of existing approaches to MAIC and provided an overview of methods for conducting feasibility assessment. I outlined techniques for enhancing precision, including my two-stage approach to MAIC and weight truncation, alongside other variance reduction methods. Harlan introduced new techniques for enhancing the bias-robustness of MAIC, including augmentation with an outcome model for doubly robust estimation. 

As always, ISPOR was a fantastic opportunity for outreach: to stay tuned with recent developments in RWD and observational science, to engage with external collaborators, and to gain insights from experts in my field. I return to Spain energized by the prospect of establishing and driving valuable research collaborations with researchers and scientists with common interests!
