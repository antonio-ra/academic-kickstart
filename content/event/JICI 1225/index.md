It was a privilege to participate in the Joint Initiative for Causal Inference seminar series, hosted by the [Center for Targeted Machine Learning and Causal Inference](https://ctml.berkeley.edu/). 

I gave a presentation on indirect treatment comparisons for health technology assessment. I tried to draw a link between practical problems encountered in health technology assessment and "data fusion" problems that have typically been viewed from a causal inference lens.
