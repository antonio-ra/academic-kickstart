At this year's ISPOR conference, I had the privilege of joining Shannon Cope (PRECISIONheor), Jeroen Paul Jansen (University of California San Francisco), Harlan Campbell (University of British Columbia) and Hwee-Lin Wee (National University of Singapore) in presenting a Spotlight Session about "Apples and oranges in the context of anchored indirect treatment comparisons â€“ Is there more to it than effect modifiers?".

The session addressed the estimation of marginal, but covariate-adjusted, treatment effects. Particular focus was placed on indirect treatment comparisons. In this context, "marginalization" or "standardization" is important to compare compatible treatment effects across studies. 

Following the session, I am happy to share two new papers. The [first article](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-024-02157-x), based on Chapter 4 of my [PhD thesis](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10144848/), shows that model-based standardization can be performed using multiple imputation techniques. 

The [second article](https://doi.org/10.1002/jrsm.1645) is a short discussion paper, touching upon aspects that were covered during the session: considerations when deciding on a weighting (e.g. MAIC) versus an outcome modelling approach (e.g. STC, G-computation): Both articles are co-authored with Gianluca Baio (University College London) and Anna Heath (Hospital for Sick Children).
