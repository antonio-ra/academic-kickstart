It was great to participate in this webinar from the [HTA European Special Interest Group](https://psiweb.org/sigs-special-interest-groups/hta) on indirect treatment comparisons, a topic that is increasingly relevant within the context of new European Union Joint Clinical Assessment and the development of the EUnetHTA 21 methodological guidelines.
