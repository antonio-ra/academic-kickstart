At ISPOR Europe 2025 in Glasgow, I joined Grammati Sarri (Cytel), Blythe Adamson (Flatiron Health) and Stephen Duffield (NICE) presenting a workshop about transportability analyses, exploring hypothetical decision problems within the context of the European Union's new Joint Clinical Assessment process. 

Grammati opened with an overview of Joint Clinical Assessments, and how these are supposed to provide "factual" evidence summaries rather than recommendations, leaving value judgments on external validity to national HTA agencies. Through a hypothetical case study, Blythe demonstrated the challenges of selecting appropriate evidence sources when trial populations, healthcare settings, and data quality differ across regions. I emphasized challenges for the acceptability of transportability analyses based on Joint Clinical Assessment methodological guidance, which contains a shifted null hypothesis testing requirement that can disincentivize the development and conduct of transportability analyses to enhance external validity. Stephen presented UK case studies (including NICE appraisals in NSCLC and urothelial cancer), illustrating how RWD are already being integrated into NICE appraisals, and underscored the importance of early engagement with HTA bodies.
