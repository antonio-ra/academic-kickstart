abstract: This Wednesday, I had the privilege of speaking alongside Shannon Cope and Harlan Campbell in a breakout session about "Advanced Methods for Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparisons (MAICs)" at #ISPORAnnual in Atlanta. Shannon chaired the session, discussed the main limitations of existing approaches to MAIC and provided an overview of methods for conducting feasibility assessment. I outlined techniques for enhancing precision, including my "two-stage" approach to MAIC and weight truncation, alongside other variance reduction methods. Harlan introduced new techniques for enhancing the bias-robustness of MAIC, including augmentation with an outcome model for doubly robust estimation. As always, ISPOR was a fantastic opportunity for outreach: to stay tuned with recent developments in RWD and observational science, to engage with external collaborators, and to gain insights from experts in my field. I return to Spain energized by the prospect of establishing and driving valuable research collaborations with researchers and scientists with common interests!
