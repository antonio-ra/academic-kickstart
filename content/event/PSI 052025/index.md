It was great to participate in this webinar on methods for integrating clinical trial evidence with external data from the [Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry](https://psiweb.org) RWD and Historical Data Special Interest Groups. I presented a common framework for externally controlled trials and indirect treatment comparisons, drawing a link between recent developments in causal inference and evidence synthesis.

There were also very interesting talks from Satrajit Roychoudhury (Pfizer), Christina Fillmore (GSK) and Isaac Gravestock (Roche) about recent methods, applications, and tools for integrating subject-level-data from clinical trials with external data using Bayesian methods and causal inference methods.
