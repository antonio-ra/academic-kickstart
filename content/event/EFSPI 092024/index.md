I recently had the great pleasure to speak alongside Lara Wolfson (MSD) and Wim Goettsch (Utrecht University and SUSTAIN-HTA) in a session about opportunities and barriers for innovative methodology in EU HTA at the [9th EFSPI Regulatory Statistics Workshop](https://efspieurope.github.io/workshop/data/2024/slides.html) in Basel. My presentation focused on indirect treatment comparisons, including considerations for covariate or population adjustment, and we were later joined by Sandro Gsteiger (Roche) and Anna Wiksten (BMS) in an exciting panel discussion.
