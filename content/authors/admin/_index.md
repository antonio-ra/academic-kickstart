## About Me

I am a statistical methodologist within the Biostatistics, Methods and Outreach department at Novo Nordisk. My expertise lies in quantitative evidence synthesis, HTA, HEOR and observational science. I am currently developing and implementing innovative statistical methods for the transportability and generalizability of research data, and for the enrichment of randomized clinical trials with real-world data sources.

I have ample experience as a statistician, researcher and statistical consultant, providing support to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare consultancy sectors. Prior to my current role, I was Lead Medical Affairs Statistician at Bayer Pharmaceuticals. Prior to that, I was an independent contractor providing statistical support to contract research organizations such as IQVIA and ICON plc, and public bodies such as SickKids.

From 2018-2021, I conducted doctoral research at the Department of Statistics, University College London, where I worked with Professor Gianluca Baio and Professor Anna Heath in the Statistics for Health Economic Evaluation research group. I have master's degrees in Machine Learning and Financial Computing from University College London, and hold an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Bath.
