abstract: The ICH E9(R1) addendum provides guidelines on accounting for intercurrent events in clinical trials using the estimands framework. However, there has been limited attention on the estimands framework for meta-analysis. Using treatment switching, a well-known intercurrent event that occurs frequently in oncology, we conducted a simulation study to explore the bias introduced by pooling together estimates targeting different estimands in a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that allowed for treatment switching. We simulated overall survival data of a collection of RCTs that allowed patients in the control group to switch to the intervention treatment after disease progression under fixed-effects and random-effects models. For each RCT, we calculated effect estimates for a treatment policy estimand that ignored treatment switching, and a hypothetical estimand that accounted for treatment switching by censoring switchers at the time of switching. Then, we performed random-effects and fixed-effects meta-analyses to pool together RCT effect estimates while varying the proportions of treatment policy and hypothetical effect estimates. We compared the results of meta-analyses that pooled different types of effect estimates with those that pooled only treatment policy or hypothetical estimates. We found that pooling estimates targeting different estimands results in pooled estimators that reflect neither the treatment policy estimand nor the hypothetical estimand. This finding shows that pooling estimates of varying target estimands can generate misleading results, even under a random-effects model. Adopting the estimands framework for meta-analysis may improve alignment between meta-analytic results and the clinical research question of interest.
