abstract: We examine four important considerations in the development of covariate adjustment methodologies for indirect treatment comparisons. First, we consider potential advantages of weighting versus outcome modeling, placing focus on bias-robustness. Second, we outline why model-based extrapolation may be required and useful, in the specific context of indirect treatment comparisons with limited overlap. Third, we describe challenges for covariate adjustment based on data-adaptive outcome modeling. Finally, we offer further perspectives on the promise of doubly robust covariate adjustment frameworks.
