abstract: To explore how the estimand framework introduced by the ICH E9(R1) Addendum on Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials is being integrated into EU Health Technology Assessment (HTA) processes, particularly within the context of Joint Clinical Assessments (JCAs). The objective is to assess the extent to which estimand attributes align with the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) framework and whether a common language is emerging between regulatory authorities and HTA agencies.
